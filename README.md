In this file, we provide:

1) the full SL label data of each cell line, including A375, A549, and Jurkat. 

Besides, the statistical data is listed as follows.

A375	   22	   513
A549	  175	  4,167
Jurkat	  295	 56,996


2) In the cell-line-specific file, we provide the training and test data, using 5-cross validation.

3) In the cell-line-adapted file, we provide the training and test data, i.e., Jurkat&A375 for training data, and A549 for test data.
